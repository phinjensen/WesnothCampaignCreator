This is a Python script that creates the _main.cfg file for Wesnoth Campaigns. It is fully functional on Windows and Linux, however, on Mac OSX it is untested.

The Script is for Python 2.x. I was working on a version for Python 3, but that was halted due to Python Imaging Library not supporting Python 3.

The Icons come from the Gnome Icon Theme.

It requires Tkinter and Python Imaging Library.
